\section*{COVER LETTER}
\vspace{0.4em}
To the People Operations department of Bigrep, Berlin, Germany:
\\
\\
My name is Gerardo A. Mazzei Capote and I’m writing you to express my interest in your company, as I have followed your products closely and believe that my 4 years of graduate study experience can complement your team extremely well. I am knowledgeable in a variety of polymer-based Additive Manufacturing technologies and CAD design, all areas of expertise that I believe would synergize well with the group of talented individuals and technologies offered by your company. I have also worked with a Cosine Additive large scale 3D printer, and after witnessing the bigrep ONE at AMUG 2019 I can guarantee that your product appears superior in almost every way.

During my previous position as teaching and research assistant at the Polymer Engineering Center, my organizational and communicational skills, as well as my eagerness to learn quickly proved to be valuable assets to Prof. Tim Osswald, co-director of the institute. My efforts directly resulted in high ratings from students in multiple classes taught, including an Additive Manufacturing class; various publications in journals, such as the Journal of Additive Manufacturing; technical presentations at world-renowned conferences of the likes of SFF, AMUG, and RAPID+TCT; and the generation of active funds for the institution through participation in multi-departmental grants and research ventures. I have also successfully managed undergraduate research assistants, and coordinated cooperative projects between universities, industry, and institutes, such as collaborations with BMW, Netzsch, the Technical University of Munich, and the University of Lyon - ENISE.

I truly believe that you possess the superior large-scale 3D printer in the market. I would love to have the opportunity to form a part of your team of professionals. If my profile interests you, it would be a privilege to discuss details of career opportunities whenever it is convenient for you. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
\\
\\
Sincerely,
\\
