To the Hiring Manager at Desktop Metal:
\\
\\
After seeing your line of products at AMUG 2019 in Chicago I was left impressed at the degree of polish of your machines, and the unique design opportunities opened up by the Studio System. My name is Gerardo, and like your founder Ric Fulop, I am a driven venezuelan eager to leverage my skills to transform the field of Additive Manufacturing.

I am known between my peers as a highly versatile and independent research scientist who works great in a team. During my graduate studies, I had to tackle a variety of challenges related to part design, fracture mechanics, data analysis, coding, polymer processing, and toolpathing. In my previous position as teaching and research assistant at the Polymer Engineering Center, my organizational and communicational skills, as well as my eagerness to learn quickly proved to be valuable assets to Prof. Tim Osswald, co-director of the institute. My efforts directly resulted in high ratings from students in multiple classes taught; technical presentations at world-renowned conferences of the likes of SFF, AMUG, and RAPID+TCT; and the generation of active funds for the institution through participation in multi-departmental grants, research ventures, and proposal submissions. I have also successfully managed undergraduate research assistants, and coordinated cooperative projects between universities, industry, and institutes, such as collaborations with BMW, Netzsch, the Technical University of Munich, and the University of Lyon - ENISE. My design expertise has resulted in the development of 3D printed heat exchangers, and a proof of concept COVID19 mask ---a project funded by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Finally, my profile offers a blend of both Materials Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, which I believe would fit perfectly with the vision and mission of the technological venture pursued by Desktop Metal.

I truly believe that Desktop Metal represents the future of metal and composite Additive Manufacturing, and I would love the opportunity to contribute to your team of engineers. If my profile interests you, it would be a privilege to discuss details of career opportunities whenever it is convenient for you. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
\\
\\
Sincerely,
\\
