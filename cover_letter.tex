\\
To the Hiring Division of BASF:
\\
\\
I am a mechanical Engineer eager to demonstrate that my profile matches really well with the needs of a Product Manager - Additive Extrusion Systems at BASF! I am known between my peers as a highly versatile, proactive, and responsible research scientist who can work great in a team, and while I don't speak Dutch, I would be excited to add a new language to my current roster.

During my graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin- Madison I had the opportunity to become acquainted in a set of skills that can easily translate to this position. In particular, I am very well versed in a variety of polymer processing techniques such as injection molding, extrusion, Fused Filament Fabrication, and Selective Laser Sintering, as well as other skills necessary to succeed in the field of Additive Manufacturing, such as CAD software, iterative part design philosophy, and mechanical failure theory.  

My excellent written and oral communication skills directly resulted in high ratings from students in multiple classes taught while working as a Teaching Assistant; technical presentations at world-renowned conferences of the likes of SFF, AMUG, and RAPID+TCT; peer-reviewed publications in journals like the Additive Manufacturing journal; and the generation of active funds for the institution through preparation of multi-departmental grants, research ventures, and proposal submissions. I have also successfully managed undergraduate research assistants, and coordinated cooperative projects between universities, industry, and institutes of the likes of BMW, Netzsch, the Technical University of Munich, and the University of Lyon - ENISE.

I believe that my aptitudes can prove beneficial to your enterprise, and I am very eager to demonstrate why over an interview. If my profile interests you, it would be a privilege to discuss details of career opportunities whenever it is convenient for you. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
\\
\\
Have a great rest of your day,
\\
