\section*{COVER LETTER}

September 24th, 2020
\\
To the Hiring Manager at Formlabs, Somerville, MA:
\\
\\
Formlabs' mission to reinvent the Additive Manufacturing industry through innovative machines and materials really resonates with me. My name is Gerardo, and I am a soon to be graduated Mechanical Engineering PhD student with a lot of experience in design for Additive Manufacturing and polymer-processing technologies.

I am known between my peers as a highly versatile and independent scientist who works great in a team. During my graduate studies, I had to tackle a variety of challenges related to fracture mechanics, data analysis, coding, and toolpathing. In my previous position as teaching and research assistant at the Polymer Engineering Center, my organizational and communicational skills, as well as my eagerness to learn quickly proved to be valuable assets to Prof. Tim Osswald, co-director of the institute. My efforts directly resulted in high ratings from students in multiple classes taught; technical presentations at world-renowned conferences of the likes of SFF, AMUG, and RAPID+TCT; and the generation of active funds for the institution through participation in multi-departmental grants and research ventures. I have also successfully managed undergraduate research assistants, and coordinated cooperative projects between universities, industry, and institutes, such as collaborations with BMW, Netzsch, the Technical University of Munich, and the University of Lyon - ENISE. Finally, my design expertise has resulted in the development of 3D printed heat exchangers, and a proof of concept COVID19 mask ---a project funded by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

I truly believe that my expertise of Additive Manufacturing technologies and polymer processing techniques can aid the talented team at Formalbs develop the next generation of vat polymerization machines, and I would love to be given the opportunity to contribute to your technological venture. If my profile interests you, it would be a privilege to discuss details of career opportunities whenever it is convenient for you. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
\\
\\
Sincerely,
\\
