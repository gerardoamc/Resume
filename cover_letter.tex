\section*{COVER LETTER}
\vspace{0.4em}
To the Human Resources department of Markforged, Watertown MA:
\\
\\
I’m writing you to apply for the position of Research and Development Engineer. I have followed your products with great interest, and I believe that my 4 years of graduate study experience complement your company extremely well. I am well versed in the fields of polymer-based Additive Manufacturing technologies, composite theory, and failure criteria, all areas of engineering that form cornerstones of the technological venture your company is pursuing.

During my previous position as teaching and research assistant at the Polymer Engineering Center, my organizational and communicational skills, as well as my eagerness to learn quickly proved to be valuable assets to Prof. Tim Osswald, co-director of the institute. My efforts directly resulted in high ratings from students in multiple classes taught, including an Additive Manufacturing class; various publications in journals, such as the Journal of Additive Manufacturing; technical presentations at world-renowned conferences of the likes of AMUG, and RAPID+TCT; and the generation of active funds for the institution through participation in multi-departmental grants and research ventures.

I believe the capability of integrating continuous fiber reinforcement into 3D printed parts to be game changing! Additionally, your Metal X system unlocks applications previously unattainable through traditional manufacturing techniques. These technological moats will surely guarantee the success of Markforged and I would love to have the opportunity to contribute to your team. If my profile interests you, it would be a privilege to discuss the details of the position whenever it is convenient for you. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
\\

Sincerely,
\\
