    One of the most common Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies is Fused
  Filament Fabrication (FFF), more commonly known by the trademarked name
  "Fused Deposition Modelingâ„¢" (FDMâ„¢). As FFF continues to gain popularity
  as a method of manufacturing, an understanding of all factors involved in the
  FFF process becomes essential. This study is an attempt to understand four
  primary printing parameters and the effects they have on part quality,
  solidity, and strength. These printing parameters are extrusion rate, nozzle
  travel speed, layer height, and path width. A recommendation for the
  determination of optimal extrusion temperature and feed rate was found. A
  theoretical relationship between the four print parameterswas developed. The
  resulting solidity was found to vary throughout a printed part, which has
  effects on the predictability of part strength. Micro computed tomography was
  proven valuable in this analysis as well as being an effective tool for
  investigating the bead structure.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The relatively low cost of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) printers and
  wide variety of materials -spanning multiple functionalities and prices- make
  this process interesting for production of functional parts. However, FFF
  produced objects underperform in terms of mechanical properties when compared
  to injection molding. Therefore, a study of tensile properties of FFF
  produced parts was conducted according to the ASTM D-638 standard, using a
  commercial and an in-house produced ABS filament. Initial tests using
  commercial ABS revealed poor reproducibility of results, which were analyzed
  in detail in this study. This led to designing a formal bed levelling
  procedure for the printer, evaluating effects of printer configuration and
  material quality as well as exploring modifications to the ASTM test
  procedure. As a result, test specimens with properties close to injection
  molding parts were produced. Therefore, the different impact factors will be
  discussed and the new procedures will be presented.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)is the most widely available Additive
  Manufacturing technology. Offering the possibility of producing complex
  geometries in a compressed product development cycle and in a plethora of
  materials, it comes as no surprise that FFF is attractive to multiple
  industries, including the automotive and aerospace segments. However, the
  high anisotropy of parts developed throu0gh this technique implies that
  failure prediction is extremely difficult -a requirement that must be
  satisfied to guarantee the safety of the final user. This work applies a
  criterion that incorporates stress interactions to define a 3D failure
  envelope that could prove an invaluable tool in formalizing the embrace of
  FFF in industry. Tensile, compressive and torsion tests were executed on
  coupons developed in a traditional FFF printer, as well as a customized,
  6-axis robotic printer necessary to produce specimens in out of ordinary
  orientations. These tests were used to calculate the parameters of the
  mathematical function that describe the failure envelope. Mechanical tests
  clearly showed significant difference between tensile, compressive and shear
  strengths. The calculated envelope shows strong interactions between axial
  loads, and a considerable interaction between shear stresses and loads
  applied in directions parallel and perpendicular to the beads.%

    {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. Parts made by fused filament
  fabrication differ in their mechanical properties from the parent material.
  To investigate the effect of the manufacturing process on the mechanical
  properties of 3D-printed parts, a series of experiments including Dynamic
  Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and ultrasonic wave propagation were conducted. For
  this purpose, printed parts were made from custom ABS filament and were
  printed using a rectangular bead shape to minimize porosity. The main
  properties investigated included the elastic, loss and storage moduli, and
  the material loss tangent (tan $\delta$). Results indicate that the elastic
  modulus of the printed material was somewhat lower than that of the parent
  material, about 2 GPa for frequencies 0.1 Hzâ€“100 Hz. Furthermore, tan
  $\delta$ was largest for the parent material at about 0.03 compared with
  0.01â€“0.02 for the printed material. Ultrasonic longitudinal wave
  measurements at 1 MHz on printed specimens with bead angles of 0Â°, 45Â° and
  90Â°, revealed minimal anisotropy and, consistent with DMA results, tan
  $\delta$ was also largest for the parent material.%

    Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is arguably the most widely available
  additive manufacturing technology at the moment. Offering the possibility of
  producing complex geometries in a compressed product development cycle and in
  a plethora of materials, it has gradually started to become attractive to
  multiple industrial segments, slowly being implemented in diverse
  applications. However, the high anisotropy of parts developed through this
  technique renders failure prediction difficult. The proper performance of the
  part, or even the safety of the final user, cannot be guaranteed under
  demanding mechanical requirements. This problem can be tackled through the
  development of a failure envelope that allows engineers to predict failure by
  using the knowledge of the stress state of the part. Previous research by the
  authors developed a failure envelope for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
  (ABS) based, Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) parts by use of a criterion
  that incorporates stress interactions. This work validates the first quadrant
  of the envelope by performing uniaxial tensile tests with coupons produced
  with a variety of raster angles, creating a combined loading stress state in
  the localized coordinate system. Results show the safe zone encompassed by
  the failure envelope proved adequate.%
